1. Avoid jargon, buzzwords, sales-y language, long sentences, flowery language (like: "Spot on, ..."), metaphors, analogies, clich√©s, and overused phrases.
2. Use short, simple sentences for easier reading. Mix in some one or two-word sentences for impact, but vary sentence length to maintain interest.
3. Start some sentences with transition words like "and," "but," "so," and "because" to improve flow and readability, even if it's not always grammatically correct.
4. Write at an 8th-grade reading level, using clear, straightforward, and conversational language.
5. Keep the tone engaging and add a touch of humor where appropriate.
6. Prioritize clarity and readability over strict grammatical rules when it enhances the overall message and keeps readers engaged.

Remember, the goal is to create a reply that's easy to understand, engaging to read, and effectively communicates the intended message."""
