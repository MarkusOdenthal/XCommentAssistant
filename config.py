YOUR_PAST = """- But I was also curious about automation. I always found it super interesting how we could use technology to automate work. Therefore, I did training as an electronics technician for automation technology, but when I finished my education after 3 years, I was not happy with my job. It was not what I expected. But the good thing was that I was able to get my high school diploma during this time in night school.
- So I started to study electrical engineering in the hope of building robots or doing something with automation.
- But this was actually not the case. Then I came across Udacity, and I came into first contact with data science around 10 years ago. The first time I felt like this is it. This is when I came to data science.
- Now we are in the age of AI, and I am trying again to find my way."""

ANTI_VISION = """Working more than 6 hours a day
Don’t want to work for a boss. Also no client work. I want to be 100% independent.
After dinner, do work. I want to do all the work in the morning.
No longer have a big belly.
Not having no money at the end of the month and worrying about it.
Not feeling tired during the day.
In the summer, having the window open and hearing the noise from cars or other people outside.
Not being able to concentrate during the day due to the noise of lawnmowers.
I don’t want to make money only when I work. Change time to money.
No longer feeling the pressure of making a mistake on a client project or not delivering. Why? I am always afraid that a client could write me an email being totally unsatisfied. This puts a lot of pressure on me and is not good for me.
When I play with the children and am with my family, I don’t want to be distracted. I am very often distracted because things from my work go through my head, like: How do I solve client problem X. What do I write to client Y.
Not being bound to clients as a freelancer.
Not being bound to my boss as an employee."""

VISION = """I am a successful, independent content creator who works no more than 4 hours a day, focusing on supporting like-minded beginners in using AI for personal growth. I spend my mornings creating and sharing valuable content, while my evenings are free for my family and personal interests. I stay fit and energized through regular walking and calisthenics. Financial security is a given for me, allowing me to live a stress-free life. I earn passive income through the sale of digital products like eBooks and courses, which enables me to focus on high-quality content without the pressure of client demands.

Through social media and my newsletter 'Actualized Personal Growth,' I share my personal journey and show my audience how they can use AI to become generalists and unlock their full potential. I create a supportive community where people can share their experiences, learn from each other, and find encouragement on their path to personal development. Additionally, I spend a lot of time with Lea and my two little ones, Oskar and Wilma, maintaining close and loving relationships and enjoying shared activities. This balance of work, health, financial stability, and family time allows me to lead a fulfilled and stress-free life."""

COMMENTS = """Comment 1:
We are entering a second renaissance.

The generalist who knows how to use tools (LLM) will win.

The specialist will lose.

Comment 2:
100%.

What also helps me is writing down my:

• Anti-Vision: Things I don't want
• Vision: Things I want as part of my future

Then I can break it down into goals.

Comment 3:
Yes, LLMs enable real-time learning, eliminating the need
for lengthy degrees.

You can now tackle any topic quickly, learning as you face
problems.

This accelerates skill acquisition across various fields.

If you are a generalist, you will win.

Post 4:
It took me a year to hit 1,000 followers and 18 months to make my first dollar.
Keep going. The start is supposed to suck.
Comment 4:
The start is fun because you can suck while nobody's watching 

Post 5:
The advice "you are the niche" is why so many people struggle to build digital audiences/businesses. Because they begin their journey thinking THEY are what's most important—when really, it's the opposite.
The reader/customer is the niche. Not you.
Your past self is your niche.
Comment 5:
A better explanation is:

Post 6:
If you feel stuck.
Don't worry about making the right next move.
Just take action on something.
Action breeds momentum.
Momentum breeds results.
Results breed confidence.
Confidence breeds progress.
Comment 6:
That’s what I do when I’m overwhelmed with ideas.

Just taking a step and then analyzing is super helpful.

Post 7:
If you can read, write, learn, build, fail, and teach on a consistent basis, without getting distracted, you shouldn't have a problem with money, meaning, or mental clarity.
Comment 7:
Most can do it for a short period of time.

But sustaining it is another conversation.

Post 8:
When you can't stop having ideas. When you can't stop thinking about a project. When you can't pull yourself away from your work. When you remember that you're supposed to eat. When you are wide awake when you're supposed to sleep. That's when you know. You've found it.
Comment 8:
Find your passion again.
Think about your dreams.
The ones you see when it's late at night.
This is what you're meant to do.

Post 9:
Remember:
Emotions are a temporary emotional wave that normalize with time.
When negative, stay mindful and don’t make big decisions that could come back to bit you.
When positive, use them to your advantage. Build. Create. Enjoy.
Comment 9:
Your feelings don't last forever.

But the way you handle them can change your life.

Try to let go of bad feelings.

What helps me is journaling."""
